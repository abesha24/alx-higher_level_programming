# Python - Hello, World

In this project, I began practicing using the interpreter, printing text
and variables, and indexing and slicing strings in Python.

# Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, I began utilizing conditionals and loops in Python by using `if`,
`if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range` statements with `while` and
`for` loops. I practiced writing my own Python functions while learning about scope of
variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.
